Instructions:
    name    type    description
    LOAD    MR      loads value from memory to register
    STORE   MR      stores value from register to memory
    LDIMM   RI      loads immediate value to register
    COPY    RR      copies value from first register to second register
    JUMP    I       jumps to the instruction at the given memory address
    ADD     RR      does arithmetic addition on first and second registers and stores the result in the first register
    SUB     RR      does arithmetic subtraction on first and second registers and stores the result in the first register
    MUL     RR      does arithmetic multiplication on first and second registers and stores the result in the first register
    DIV     RR      does arithmetic division on first and second registers and stores the result in the first register
    BSL     RR      bitwise shifts first register left by second register and stores the result in the first register
    BSR     RR      bitwise shifts first register right by second register and stores the result in the first register
    AND     RR      does a bitwise and on first and second registers and stores the result in the first register
    OR      RR      does a bitwise or on first and second registers and stores the result in the first register
    XOR     RR      does a bitwise exclusive or on first and second registers and stores the result in the first register
