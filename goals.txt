Computing
    - Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
    - All binary logical operators

IO
    - Low-latency and maskable interrupts, at least 2 sources

Protection
    - NOTE: Better not to worry about any of this till a working version
    - Two privilege levels / rings
    - Ring 1 may not:
        * access memory
        * access IO
        * define syscalls
    - Ring 0 can define syscalls, syscalls can be called from ring 1 and they should have ring 0 privileges
    - TODO: how should interrupts be treated in ring 1?

Miscellaneous
    - Simplicity over performance
    - Preferably a COPY instruction that is atleast as fast as loading a single byte from ROM
        * This allows RR instructions that must not overwrite input values to be as fast as a theoretical RRR instruction
