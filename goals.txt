Computing
    - Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
    - All binary logical operators

IO
    - Low-latency and maskable interrupts, at least 2 sources

Miscellaneous
    - Simplicity over performance
    - Preferably a COPY instruction that is atleast as fast as loading a single byte from ROM
        * This allows RR instructions that must not overwrite input values to be as fast as a theoretical RRR instruction
